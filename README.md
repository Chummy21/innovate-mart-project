## üìå Overview
This repository contains my submission for the AltSchool Cloud Engineering Program (Semester 3, Month 2) assessment.

The goal of this project focuses on deploying **InnovateMart‚Äôs Retail Store Application** to AWS **Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** with an emphasis on automation, security, and scalability.

The implementation covers:  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform  
- **Kubernetes deployment** of microservices  
- **CI/CD automation** with GitHub Actions  
- **IAM roles and developer access**

## üöÄ Step 1: Provisioning Infrastructure with Terraform

1. I started by creating a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Terraform. To ensure flexibility and reusability, I stored all variable values inside terraform.tfvars.

   - Defined CIDR block for the VPC.

   - Configured public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.

   - Attached Internet Gateway (IGW) to enable external connectivity for public subnets.

   - Created NAT Gateways to allow private subnets to access the internet securely.

   - Added Route Tables and associated them with the appropriate subnets (public or private).

  - Managed input variables via variables.tf and provided their values inside terraform.tfvars for better organization.

   This setup ensures the EKS cluster runs inside a secure, scalable, and highly available network.

2. Provisioned **EKS cluster**:
   
   - After setting up the VPC, I provisioned an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster using Terraform.
   
   - Cluster Name: innovatemart-cluster
  
   - Kubernetes Version: 1.30
  
   - Node Group: t3.small (EKS Managed Node Group)
  
   - Scaling Configuration:

     Desired nodes: 2

     Minimum nodes: 2

     Maximum nodes: 4

     This setup ensures the cluster has enough compute capacity to handle workloads, while maintaining scalability through auto-scaling between 2‚Äì4 nodes.

     The cluster was configured with IAM roles, security groups, and add-ons (CoreDNS, VPC CNI, kube-proxy, etc.) to ensure proper networking, service discovery, and cluster management.

3. IAM Roles & Policies:  

   To enable secure access and fine-grained permissions, I created the following IAM roles and policies:
   
   - EKS Cluster Role ‚Äì Grants the EKS control plane the necessary permissions to manage AWS resources such as EC2 instances and networking.

   - Node Group Role ‚Äì Provides worker nodes (EC2 instances in the node group) with permissions to connect to the EKS cluster and interact with AWS services (e.g., pulling images from         ECR, using VPC CNI).

   - Read-Only Developer User ‚Äì An IAM user with restricted access (view-only) to the cluster, following the principle of least privilege. This ensures developers can inspect resources        without making changes.

## üåê Step 2: Deploying the Retail Store Application

- Installed and configured kubectl to connect with the EKS cluster.

- Applied the `kubernetes.yaml` file to deploy all the microservices.

- Verified deployment ‚Äî all pods are in Running state ‚úÖ (healthy cluster).

- The UI service is exposed as a LoadBalancer, and AWS automatically provisioned an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to make the application accessible externally.
 

- ## Kubernetes Services

To check the services in my cluster, I ran:

```bash
kubectl get svc

ui   LoadBalancer   172.20.99.37   aadfff0a2b7434dab89ee4f2d36a6f64-17783841.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com   80:30251/TCP   2m50s

``` 

Copied the URL and confirmed the UI was accessible.

LoadBalancer URL:[http://aadfff0a2b7434dab89ee4f2d36a6f64-17783841.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com](http://aadfff0a2b7434dab89ee4f2d36a6f64-17783841.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com)

##  ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: CI/CD Automation

To ensure repeatable and automated deployments, a GitHub Actions workflow was set up under .github/workflows.

The workflow handles:

- Terraform Initialization ‚Üí Prepares the working directory with Terraform plugins and backend configuration.

- Terraform Plan (Feature Branches) ‚Üí Runs terraform plan when code is pushed to non-main branches, helping preview infrastructure changes.

- Terraform Apply (Main Branch) ‚Üí Automatically applies changes to AWS when changes are merged into main.

- Secure AWS Credentials ‚Üí GitHub Secrets were used to store and inject AWS Access Keys, ensuring credentials are not hard-coded.
